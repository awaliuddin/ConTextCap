I'll help you create the "Codebase Capture" application. For cross-platform compatibility and modern UI design, we'll use PyQt6 as our GUI framework.



Let me explain the key components of the implementation:

1. **GUI Framework Choice**
- PyQt6 was chosen because it:
  * Provides a modern, cross-platform interface
  * Has excellent documentation and community support
  * Offers built-in support for threading and progress dialogs
  * Maintains native look and feel across different operating systems

2. **Key Classes**

a. `DirectoryScanner (QThread)`
- Handles directory traversal in a separate thread
- Counts total items for accurate progress reporting
- Generates a text-based directory structure
- Emits signals for progress updates and completion

b. `PDFGenerator (QThread)`
- Manages PDF creation in a separate thread
- Uses FPDF for PDF generation
- Handles different file types appropriately
- Includes progress reporting and error handling

c. `CodebaseCaptureWindow (QMainWindow)`
- Main application window
- Manages user interface and event handling
- Coordinates between scanner and PDF generator
- Handles user interaction and feedback

3. **Error Handling**
- File access errors are caught and reported
- Unicode decoding errors are handled gracefully
- Progress operations can be cancelled
- User feedback for all operations

4. **Progress Tracking**
- Two-pass approach for accurate progress reporting
- Separate threads for long-running operations
- Modal progress dialogs with cancel option
- Clear success/failure notifications

To extend or modify the application:

1. Add file filtering:
```python
def is_allowed_file(file_path: Path) -> bool:
    """Filter files based on extension or other criteria"""
    excluded = {'.git', '__pycache__', 'node_modules'}
    return not any(ex in file_path.parts for ex in excluded)
```

2. Add file type icons:
```python
def get_file_icon(file_path: Path) -> QIcon:
    """Return appropriate icon based on file type"""
    mime_type, _ = mimetypes.guess_type(str(file_path))
    # Map mime types to icons
    return icon_map.get(mime_type, default_icon)
```

3. Add configuration options:
```python
def save_settings(self):
    """Save application settings"""
    settings = QSettings('CodebaseCapture', 'Settings')
    settings.setValue('last_directory', self.selected_path)
    settings.setValue('exclude_patterns', self.exclude_patterns)
```

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect in more detail or add additional features?
